In this assessment, you will create a SQL script to create the structure of a database starting from a defined ERD.

Step 1: Create the Tables
Choose one of the database design activities and create a schema or ERD for the selected database, if you have not already done so.

Use DDL to create the tables identified in the schema, using data types appropriate for the target RDBMS.

Each table should include all required fields and settings, with a separate CREATE TABLE statement for each table.
Test that you can create each table without error and that each table includes the correct fields and settings.
Step 2: Create a SQL Script
After you have confirmed that the SQL statements to create the tables work as expected, create a script that someone else can use to rebuild the database structure in the same RDBMS.

The first line of the script should drop the database if it exists.
The second line of the script should create a database with the same name as the dropped database.
The third line of the script should USE the new database.
Add the series of statements used to create the tables following the USE statement.

Save the file after making the changes.

Step 3: Test the Script
Before marking this exercise done, verify that you can run the script in your RDBMS without errors.

After running the script, verify that all of the tables exist and that their structure matches that of the ERD included at the beginning of this exercise.
